# prospektor
this is a simple google maps scraper i built for my friend to retrieve prospects to a given niche and location.
it works by opening google maps with pupetteer and searching for a search string (eg. 'mechanics in new york').
it then opens each result and saves the information of it.
additionally if a website url is present we will visit it to find a url for an imprint to scrape possible names or email adresses.

## Usage:
- `git clone https://github.com/Quentiiiin/prospektor.git`
- `cd prospektor`
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
